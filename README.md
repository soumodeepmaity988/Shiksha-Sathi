# 🧠 Agents setup

```
cd agents
```

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

### 1. Create `.env` file in root directory

```
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<PROJECT>
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=<LOCATION>
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STAGING_BUCKET=<BUCKET>
AGENT_ID=projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/reasoningEngines/<AGENT_ENGINE_ID>
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
COURSE_PLAN_SHEET_NAME='Course Plan'
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_B64=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

# 🧩 Python Dependencies

Add the following to requirements.txt:

```
google-adk>=0.0.2
google-cloud-aiplatform[agent_engines]>=1.91.0,!=1.92.0
google-genai>=1.5.0,<2.0.0
dotenv>=0.9.9
gspread
```

Then install using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 🚀 Test agent in local

To test the agents in local
run

```
adk web
```

# 🚀 Deploy / Update Agent on Vertex AI Engine

File: deployment/deploy.py

- create() – Creates a new agent engine on Vertex AI
- get_engine(agent_id) – Fetches an existing agent by ID
- update(agent_id) – Updates the agent logic if it exists, else creates new
- main() – Entry point (decides to update or create based on AGENT_ID)
- By default, this creates a new agent engine unless you provide AGENT_ID in .env.

🔧 To Deploy:
Activate virtual environment (if needed):

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

Run deployment script:

```
python deployment/deploy.py
```

or

```
poetry run python deployment/deploy.py
```

📌 Notes

- SERVICE_ACCOUNT_B64: should be a base64-encoded string of your service account JSON file
- GOOGLE_SHEET_ID: must refer to a sheet with columns like: Schedule Date, Topic, Teacher, Class, Subject. [Google sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V65GAje9c9NdXXXUH-mkcepZYmqyf_QgeedewRQw_W0/edit?gid=1103212698#gid=1103212698)
- Gemini will persist the topic fetched at the start and will not re-fetch it during the session

✅ Success Checklist

- .env file configured with all required variables
- Python dependencies installed
- Agent deployed successfully on Vertex AI Engine
- Google Sheet connected and today's topic available
